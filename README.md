This is a simple Next.js project with two main parts:
- Destination Search: Allow users to search for travel destinations by name.
- Destination Details: Display detailed information about the selected destination, including its name, description, country climate, currency and top 5 nearby destinations.

To run this project, you need to install it locally using npm, and then run it:
